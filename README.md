# polymarket-userscripts
After actively using polymarket for some time I decide to introduce a couple of UI features I would like the platform to have. I have implemented them as userscripts integrated via [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net). Feel free to explore if they could be interesting for you. The open source nature of the code is a guarantee of security of your account. Feedback and ideas are appreciated. Contact me at Discord `firedigger`
The script can be added to [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) extension for auto-loading, but you can try the script manually without installing anything just by going to the polymarket website and pasting the desired JS file contents into the console window.
After installing click "Create new script", paste the JS file content into the window and save. The script will activate on the corresponding pages immediately after a reload and will proceed to be applied automatically until toggled off.

## Daily position price change
Polymarket deposit page shows daily portfolio development. However, it is often tricky, if you have many active bets, to notice which bet exactly caused the majority of the position value movement, as some bet prices tend to be volatile.  
The offered polymarket userscript allows you to conviniently track daily price changes not just of your whole account, but per position you have. The main benefit is being able to track which positions have made most impact on your daily account standing. The daily change will appear in "Latest" column on portfolio page or "Current" column on profile page:

A change figure is written as long as the API returns a value for it. In most cases the absense of value means no change in price since yesterday. At the moment it won't work on "Load more" positions, only first 100 positions are processed.
## Market annualized return rate
You have probably seen many markets with an extremely expected outcome, where one side would be trading at 90+. Some of those seems like a safe bet, free money. But apart from the price, another fundamental attribute of a market is the deadline, and price will naturally be converging to 100 up to the deadline. ARR number will let you conviniently compare several "safe-bet" markets by calculating the annualized return on investement of the market, assuming the likely outcome prevails. You may then compare the number to 5% regarded as the risk-free benchmark (bank deposit/bonds), and up to 30% for a lower risk stock market investment (majority of recent S&P 500 years).  With that said, placing a bet on a market with less than 30% ARR might be not the best investment idea considering there is a certain risk to lose the whole deposit amount (whereas even in an event of US market crash S&P 500 would not be expected to lose more than 50%). And constantly moving the money around those lower-risk bets with reasonable ARR will grant your the desired yield. But of course be aware of the risk because statistically unlikely events do happen sometimes.
The script ammends the figure alongisde the deadline of the market. At this moment the figure only works for single-market event pages (it won't work on pages with multiple proposed options on a single page).

## Unrealized profit and maximum likelihood portfolio value
Transparency is a strong point of the polymarket platform. All bettors' profiles are public - their positions, history, profits. And especially from the comment section if you see an arrogant speaker, you can instantly check if his money was as successful as his mouth would claim. However, the profit figure from the profile is a merge of past bets and current position gains. Consequently, the script extracts the current portfolio profit from the positions, which lets you tell the bettor's past history against the comtemporary sentiment. The figure under the profil will show unrealized profit, and you can subtract that value to calculate the past profits.  
Each position in the portfolio has a "To win" value showing the outcome amount if your guess is correct. However, this figure is not accumulated for all rows nor anyone expects to win every single bet they bought. Portfolio value mathematically represents the Estimated Value of the active bets based on the market probabilities. The script introduces a simple way to estimate the potential monetary outcome of your positions, by treating each contemporary bet with >50% chance as a win and <50% as a loss, and accumulating the rows. This mathematically is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimate. It might not happen precisely but statistically that is the single most probable outcome when all bets complete. I believe it could be a useful figure especially if you combine many high-chance and low-chance bets. The MLE value will be rendered under the portfolio value on the profile page.
